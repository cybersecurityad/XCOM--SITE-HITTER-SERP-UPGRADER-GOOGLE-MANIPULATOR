## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email us directly** at security@xcom.dev
3. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability
4. **Wait for confirmation** before public disclosure

### What to Include

Please provide the following information:
- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** assessment
- **Suggested fixes** (if any)
- **Your contact information**

### Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment completion**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 3-7 days
  - Medium: 1-2 weeks
  - Low: Next release cycle

## üîê Security Features

### Built-in Protections

#### Network Security
- **Tor routing** for all traffic
- **Dutch-only exit nodes** for geographic isolation
- **No data persistence** beyond session logs
- **Clean session termination**

#### Browser Security
- **Anti-detection measures** to prevent fingerprinting
- **No credential storage** or sensitive data caching
- **Isolated browser instances** for each session
- **Proper cleanup** of temporary files

#### Application Security
- **Input validation** on all user inputs
- **Safe file operations** with proper permissions
- **Error handling** without information leakage
- **Secure random generation** for timing and behavior

### Security Considerations

#### For Users
- ‚úÖ **Only test authorized websites**
- ‚úÖ **Use appropriate rate limiting**
- ‚úÖ **Follow local laws and regulations**
- ‚úÖ **Keep software updated**

#### For Developers
- ‚úÖ **Validate all inputs**
- ‚úÖ **Use secure coding practices**
- ‚úÖ **Regular dependency updates**
- ‚úÖ **Code review for security issues**

## üîç Security Auditing

### Regular Reviews
- **Dependency scanning** with automated tools
- **Code review** for security implications
- **Penetration testing** of the application itself
- **Third-party security audits** (planned)

### Known Security Considerations

#### Tor Network Limitations
- **Exit node trustworthiness** varies
- **Traffic analysis** possible by advanced adversaries
- **Network performance** may impact stealth
- **Geographic restrictions** may limit Dutch nodes

#### Browser Automation Risks
- **Detection by anti-bot systems** is possible
- **Fingerprinting** through behavior analysis
- **Rate limiting** may trigger blocking
- **Legal implications** of automated testing

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Deployment Security

#### Production Use
```bash
# Use virtual environments
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Keep dependencies updated
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Use headless mode for servers
config.headless = True

# Enable proper logging
config.save_screenshots = False  # For privacy
```

#### Access Control
- **Restrict access** to authorized personnel only
- **Use strong authentication** if deploying remotely
- **Monitor usage** with appropriate logging
- **Regular access reviews**

### Configuration Security

#### Safe Defaults
```python
# Recommended security settings
config.verify_dutch_ip = True      # Verify geographic location
config.headless = True             # Reduce detection surface
config.save_screenshots = False    # Minimize data storage
config.max_retries = 3             # Limit retry attempts
```

#### Network Configuration
- **Use trusted DNS** servers
- **Monitor network traffic** for anomalies
- **Implement rate limiting** appropriately
- **Regular Tor circuit rotation**
