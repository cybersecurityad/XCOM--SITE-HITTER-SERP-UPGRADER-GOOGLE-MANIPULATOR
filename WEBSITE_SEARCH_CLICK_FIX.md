# Website Search & Click - Automatic First Link Fix

## Issue Fixed
The Website Search & Click function (Option 3) was requiring manual user input to select which link to click from the search results, which was causing errors and interrupting the automation flow.

## Solution Implemented
Modified the `website_search_and_click()` function in `tor_menu.py` to:

### âœ… **Automatic First Link Selection**
- **Before**: Asked user to manually select which link to click (1-N)
- **After**: Automatically clicks the first matching link found
- **Benefit**: Fully automated without user interaction during execution

### âœ… **Improved Error Handling**
- Fixed indentation issues in the link clicking logic
- Added proper exception handling for link clicking operations
- Streamlined the code flow to eliminate manual input prompts

### âœ… **Enhanced User Experience**
- Shows all matching links found (for transparency)
- Automatically selects and clicks the first match
- Displays which link is being clicked with URL confirmation
- Maintains all human simulation and timing features

## Technical Changes

### Key Code Modifications
```python
# OLD CODE (Manual Selection)
if len(matching_links) == 1:
    choice = 1
    print("âœ… Only one match found, automatically selecting it.")
else:
    choice = int(input(f"Select link to click (1-{len(matching_links)}): "))

# NEW CODE (Automatic Selection)
# Automatically click the first matching link
selected_link = matching_links[0]
print(f"ðŸŽ¯ Automatically clicking first match: {selected_link['text']}")
```

### Workflow Now
1. **Visit Target Website** â†’ Load the specified URL
2. **Search for Keywords** â†’ Find all links containing search terms  
3. **Display Results** â†’ Show all matching links for transparency
4. **Auto-Click First** â†’ Automatically click the first matching link
5. **Human Simulation** â†’ Perform realistic browsing behavior
6. **Extended Stay** â†’ Stay on page for configured time

## Example Usage
```
Option 3: Website Search & Click
Website URL: https://onderzoekportaal.nl
Keywords: verenigd amsterdam
Result: Automatically finds and clicks first link containing "verenigd amsterdam"
```

## Benefits
- âœ… **Fully Automated**: No manual intervention required
- âœ… **Error-Free**: Eliminates input validation errors
- âœ… **Consistent**: Always selects first match for predictable behavior
- âœ… **Transparent**: Still shows all found links for user awareness
- âœ… **Efficient**: Faster execution without waiting for user input

## Compatibility
- Works with all existing Dutch Tor rotation features
- Maintains all human simulation behaviors
- Compatible with extended timing and repeat configurations
- Fully integrated with the global configuration system
