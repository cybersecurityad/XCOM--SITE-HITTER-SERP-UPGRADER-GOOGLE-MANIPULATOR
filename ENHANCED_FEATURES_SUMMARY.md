New Configuration Options Added:
--------------------------------

1. ⏰ PAGE STAY TIME (10-60 minutes)
   - Configurable time to stay on each page
   - Range: 10-60 minutes
   - Shows progress during stay time
   - Menu option 16: "Set page stay time (10-60 minutes)"

2. 🔁 SIMULATION REPEAT COUNT
   - How many times to repeat the simulation
   - Values: 1+ for limited repeats, 0 for infinite
   - Menu option 17: "Set simulation repeat count"
   - Supports Ctrl+C interruption for infinite mode

Enhanced URL Testing:
--------------------

The custom URL test (option 1) now implements:

1. 🔄 CYCLE-BASED SIMULATION
   - Each cycle visits the URL once
   - Stays on page for configured time
   - Shows progress every 30 seconds
   - Repeats for specified number of cycles

2. ⏰ EXTENDED PAGE INTERACTION
   - Simulates long-form reading/browsing
   - Maintains active session during stay time
   - Realistic human-like behavior patterns

3. 🔁 INFINITE MODE SUPPORT
   - Set repeat count to 0 for infinite simulation
   - Useful for long-term testing
   - Safe interruption with Ctrl+C

4. 📊 ENHANCED PROGRESS TRACKING
   - Shows current cycle number
   - Tracks total successful visits
   - Displays remaining time on page
   - Summary statistics at completion

Menu Structure:
--------------

Main Menu:
1. 🎯 Custom URL (Full Simulation) - NOW WITH EXTENDED FEATURES
2. 🔍 Batch URL Testing
3. 🧪 HTTPBin Testing
4. ⚙️  Browser Configuration - NOW WITH 18 OPTIONS
5. 📋 Show Current Configuration - NOW SHOWS NEW SETTINGS
6. 🚪 Exit

Configuration Menu (18 options):
1-15. [Previous options]
16. ⏰ Set page stay time (10-60 minutes) - NEW
17. 🔁 Set simulation repeat count - NEW
18. 🔙 Back to main menu

Configuration Display:
---------------------

The "Show Current Configuration" now includes:

⏰ EXTENDED SIMULATION:
⏰ Page stay time: X.X minutes
🔁 Simulation repeats: X (or "Infinite")

Example Usage Scenarios:
-----------------------

1. LONG-TERM MONITORING:
   - Set stay time: 30 minutes
   - Set repeats: 0 (infinite)
   - Monitor website over extended periods

2. STRESS TESTING:
   - Set stay time: 10 minutes
   - Set repeats: 50
   - Test website performance under sustained load

3. HUMAN BEHAVIOR SIMULATION:
   - Set stay time: 15 minutes
   - Set repeats: 5
   - Simulate realistic user engagement

4. QUICK TESTING:
   - Set stay time: 10 minutes (minimum)
   - Set repeats: 1
   - Quick verification tests

Technical Implementation:
------------------------

1. NEW CONFIG FIELDS:
   - page_stay_time_minutes: float = 5.0
   - simulation_repeat_count: int = 1

2. ENHANCED VISIT LOGIC:
   - Cycle-based repetition
   - Progress tracking during stay time
   - Graceful interruption handling
   - Session continuity management

3. MENU INTEGRATION:
   - Input validation (10-60 minutes)
   - Infinite mode support (0 = infinite)
   - Real-time configuration display
   - User-friendly progress indicators

Benefits:
--------

✅ Realistic long-term user simulation
✅ Configurable engagement patterns  
✅ Stress testing capabilities
✅ Enhanced monitoring options
✅ Professional progress tracking
✅ Safe interruption mechanisms
✅ Flexible timing controls
✅ Infinite simulation support

The enhanced simulation system now supports professional-grade web automation
with realistic human behavior patterns over extended time periods.
